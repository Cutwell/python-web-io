# Why use Python Web I/O?

## Ease of use
The initial concept of Python Web I/O was to enable users to generate web interfaces from any python application. Whilst this framework offers much more, this core feature enables instant integration with your Python projects.

## Production-grade
We use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) as backend technologies to power Python Web I/O. Used in combination, this tech stack elevates us beyond novelty, and into something that can be deployed and used in serious use-cases.

## Highly customisable
Unlike other python-based web frameworks, we provide no pre-built components, in favour of allowing the user to develop HTML code to their precise specification. Greater customisablity = more power to the user.
